This project is aimed to build a system that can detect unlicensed vehicles
in Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) lanes by utilizing yolov8, computer vision and
Optical Character Recognition (OCR). License plate detection will be
supported by a YOLOv8 model trained specifically for license plates to
identify and locate vehicles having license plates in dedicated BRT lanes.
Next In line the text we will extract from vehicles with EasyOCR These
cameras will capture the license plate and then cross reference that
information to a database of all license plates used by people permitted onto
that BRT lane. The successful rate of performance has been assessed based
on detecting blacklisted cars and capturing their plates.
